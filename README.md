# QB-CORE Dirty Water item and screen effect 

## This is not a drag and drop script, instructions on what to copy and paste and where to copy and paste are located inside the file! :) 

Dirty Water adds a cool survival twist to your FiveM server. When players drink a dirty water item like one collected from a fire hydrant, they’ll get hit with a sickness effect. It’s all built-in: screen blur, light camera shake, and slow health loss over time. Players will get notifications while they’re sick, and it all clears up after a bit. It’s a great way to make your server feel a bit grittier, especially in zombie or survival-themed setups!
